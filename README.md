# derpy

Some mouse-following web browser toy I wrote back in summer 2013, designed to be embedded in webpages. Originally hosted at [juju2143.ca/derpy](http://juju2143.ca/derpy "derp"), it has since been integrated in various Facebook pages and forum shoutboxes as an easter egg. It is now back in glorious forkable git repository form for your pleasure!

Have fun!
